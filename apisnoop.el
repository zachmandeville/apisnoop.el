;;; Commentary:
;; This is a potentially growing list of helper functions for when you are using apisnoop and emacs together.
;; It's also a chance to better learn how to write emacs packages.  It's niche, but a nice niche!

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun apisnoop/insert-ticket-template ()
  "Inserts contents of the \"ticket-template.org\" file stored in your current directory."
  (interactive)
  (let ((template-file "./ticket-template.org"))
    (if (file-exists-p template-file)
        (insert-file-contents template-file)
      (message "No ticket-template.org found in current directory: %s." default-directory))))
